This repository contains the work I did for my Senior Project at Cal Poly SLO, advised by Dr. Franz Kurfess.

The project combines a Raspberry Pi with a camera module and vision processing unit to identify birds using 
image classification. The files for this portion of the project are contained in the folder RPiBirdClassification.
I made an accompanying app in React native to make it easy to view these images from a mobile device, the files
for which can be found in the folder BirdsReactApp.
